    <h1>Rock-paper-scissors</h1>
    <h2>What it is</h2>
    <p>
      Rock-paper-scissors is a quick win-loose game that is often used to
      determine who will go first or who will win some other small privilege.
    </p>
    <h2>Best for</h2>
    <p>
      Two players. But you could have a giant rock-paper-scissors tournament
      with tons of people!
    </p>
    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing! Well, technically speaking, each player needs to use their two
      hands.
    </p>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>
        In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three
      hand signs: rock (made by making a fist), paper (made by laying your hand
      flat), or scissors (made by holding out two fingers to look like
      scissors). Both players show their signs at the same time to see who will
      win. Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)</li>
      <li>Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)</li>
      <li>Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If both players show the same sign, it’s a tie. And that’s basically the
      whole game! It’s often played in a best-two-out-of-three format as a quick
      contest to decide who gets to go first or something like that.
